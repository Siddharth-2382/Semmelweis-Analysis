# Investigating Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
This project explores the discovery of the importance of handwashing in medical settings, as led by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis in the mid-1800s. By analyzing historical data on maternal mortality rates at Vienna General Hospital, this project aims to provide insight into the methods and findings of Dr. Semmelweis's research.

## Overview
In the mid-1800s, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis observed that the maternal mortality rate at Vienna General Hospital was much higher in one ward than in another. He hypothesized that this difference was due to the doctors and medical students in one ward performing autopsies before delivering babies, and then not washing their hands before assisting in childbirth in the same ward. Dr. Semmelweis implemented a policy of handwashing with chlorinated lime, and saw a drastic reduction in maternal mortality rates in the ward where this policy was implemented.

This project investigates Dr. Semmelweis's discovery by analyzing historical data on maternal mortality rates at Vienna General Hospital, and looking at trends in mortality rates before and after the implementation of the handwashing policy.

## Data
The data used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arijit75/survey-data), and consists of monthly counts of births and deaths due to puerperal fever at Vienna General Hospital from 1841 to 1849. The data is presented in two separate files, one for the ward where the handwashing policy was implemented, and one for the control ward where no such policy was put in place.
<br />
## Method
To analyze the data, this project uses the Python programming language, and several data analysis libraries including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any invalid entries or missing values, and then visualized using line charts and other graphs to identify trends in maternal mortality rates over time.
<br />
## Results
The results of this analysis show a clear difference in maternal mortality rates between the ward where the handwashing policy was implemented and the control ward where no such policy was put in place. The implementation of the handwashing policy led to a significant reduction in maternal mortality rates, supporting Dr. Semmelweis's hypothesis that handwashing was a critical factor in preventing the spread of puerperal fever in medical settings.
<br />
## Conclusion
This project provides insight into the importance of data analysis in medical research, and highlights the crucial role that Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis played in advancing medical knowledge through his discovery of the importance of handwashing. By analyzing historical data on maternal mortality rates at Vienna General Hospital, this project demonstrates the power of data analysis in uncovering important trends and insights that can lead to significant improvements in public health.
